  h3 This is an application for finding similar streams to those you already watch.
  p I've spent the last few weeks creating an app to recommend streams for Twitch.tv. It has actually been collecting and processing viewer data for about a month, and I plan on refreshing the website's data about once a week. It collects data through Twitch's chat api, which I know can change at any point, but it will not break the site directly, so I will have time to fix it. The system works pretty well at determining what streams for you to watch, and my next step will be to add resources for channel owners to see who their viewers are watching. (Hey ChannelA, did you know that 20% of your viewers also watch ChannelB?)
  p There are some caveats in the way the system works. For example, it takes some time for the system to generate a list of channels that you view or should view. For 99% of the viewers, this is not an issue, but for those that view a lot, mainly bots, it is an issue, so I currently limit the number of channels that it uses for computation to 20, so it is possible you will actually get different results if you have viewed more than 20 channels. Also, I have made it a point to only include channels that are currently live, because it doesn't make much sense to show channels that you can't see right now. I wanted to have the recommendation based on the number of viewers that you watch channels with, but I have also implemented a solution to make sure that streams that have a large amount of viewers, ex: riotgames, does not weigh as heavily into the recommendation.
  p I am currently on my way back from a vacation with my family, so after I get back, I will be cleaning up the code, opensourcing it, and making major modifications / additions. If you care for updates, you can get my contact details off the contact page. If you have any complaints or suggestions, feel free to tweet to me @jmsaucier. Excuse the lazy UI, I prefer server-side development :)
